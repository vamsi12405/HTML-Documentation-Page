<h1 style="text-align:left;" id="whatisC">What is C++ </h1>

<p>C++ is a general purpose programming language and widely used now a days ' for competitive programming. 
It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features. C++ runs on lots of platform like Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac etc. C++ is an efficient and powerful language and finds wide use in various GUI platforms,
 3D graphics and real-time simulations. Because of the inclusion of rich function libraries, working in C++ becomes simpler and convenient than C. Being object-oriented programming like Java, C++ provides the 
 support of inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, etc.
 Unlike C, C++ allows exception handling and function overloading. </p>
 
 <p> <q>Hello World </q> program is the first step towards
 learning any programming language and also one of the simplest 
 programs you will learn. All you have to do is display the message 
 <q>Hello World</q> on the screen. </p>
 
 <p>Let us now look at the program:<p>
 
 <code>
 #include<br>
 using namespace std;<br>
 int main()<br>
 {<br>
 cout << <q>Hello World</q>;<br>
 return 0;<br>
 }
 </code>
 
 <p> C++ is an Object Oriented Programming Language.
The main pillars of Object Oriented Programming are : <p>
<ul class="C">
<li>Objects and Classes</li>
<li>Inheritence</li>
<li>Polymorphism</li>
<li>Abstraction</li>
<li>Encapsulation</li>
</ul>

<div id="objectsandclasses"> Obejcts and Classes</div>

<p>Object-oriented programming â€“ As the name suggests 
uses objects in programming. Object-oriented programming 
aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, 
polymorphism, etc in programming. The main aim of OOP is to bind 
together the data and the functions that operate on them so that 
no other part of the code can access this data except that function. </p>

<p><strong>Object :</strong>An Object is an identifiable entity with some characteristics and behavior. 
An Object is an instance of a Class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated (i.e. an object 
is created) memory is allocated.</p>

<p><strong> Class:</strong>The building block of C++ that leads to Object-Oriented programming is a Class. It is a user-defined data type, 
which holds its own data members and member functions, which can be accessed & used by creating an instance of that class. A class is 
like a blueprint for an object. For Example: Consider the Class of Cars. There may be many cars with different names and brand but all 
of them will share some common properties like all of them will have 4 wheels, Speed Limit, Mileage range etc. So here, Car is the class
 and wheels, speed limits, mileage are their properties. </p>
 
 <div id="inheritence">Inheritence</div>
 
 <p>The capability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from another class is called Inheritance. Inheritance is one of the most 
 important feature of Object Oriented Programming. Sub Class: The class that inherits properties from another class is called Sub class or Derived Class. 
 Super Class: The class whose properties are inherited by sub class is called Base Class or Super class. Using inheritance, we have to write the functions 
 only one time instead of three times as we have inherited rest of the three classes from base class(Vehicle). </p>

<strong>Mode of Inheritance</strong>

<p><strong>Public Mode: </strong>If we derive a sub class from a public base class. Then the public member of the base class will become public in the derived 
class and protected members of the base class will become protected in derived class.</p>

<p><strong>Protected Mode:</strong> If we derive a sub class from a Protected base class. Then both public member and protected members of the base class will 
become protected in derived class.</p>

<p><strong>Private Mode:</strong>If we derive a sub class from a Private base class. Then both public member and protected members of the base class will become
Private in derived class.</p>

<h4> Types of Inheritance in C++:</h4>

<p><strong>Single Inheritence</strong>In single inheritance, a class is allowed to inherit from only one class. i.e. one sub class is inherited by one base 
class only.</p>

<p><strong>Multiple Inheritence:</strong> Multiple Inheritance is a feature of C++ where a class can inherit from more than one classes. i.e one sub class is inherited
from more than one base classes.</p>

<p><strong>Multilevel Inheritence:</strong> In this type of inheritance, a derived class is created from another derived class.</p>

<p><strong>Hierarchical Inheritance:</strong>In this type of inheritance, more than one sub class is inherited from a single base class i.e. more than one derived class is created from a single base class.</p>

<p><strong>Hybrid Inheritance:</strong>Hybrid Inheritance is implemented by combining more than one type of inheritance. For example: Combining Hierarchical inheritance and Multiple Inheritance.</p>

<div id="polymorphism">Polymorphism</div>
<br>
<p>The word polymorphism means having many forms. In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form. A real-life example of polymorphism, a person at the 
same time can have different characteristics. Like a man at the same time is a father, a husband, an employee. So the same person posses different behavior in different situations. This is called polymorphism.
Polymorphism is considered as one of the important features of Object Oriented Programming</p>

<h4>In C++ polymorphism is mainly divided into two types:</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li>Compile time Polymorphism</li>
<li>Runtime Polymorphism</li>
</ol>

<p>Compile time polymorphism: This type of polymorphism is achieved by function overloading or operator overloading.
Runtime polymorphism: This type of polymorphism is achieved by Function Overriding.</p>

<div id="abstraction">Abstraction</div>
<p>Data abstraction is one of the most essential and important feature of object oriented programming in C++. Abstraction means displaying only essential information and hiding the details. Data abstraction refers to 
providing only essential information about the data to the outside world, hiding the background details or implementation.
Consider a real life example of a man driving a car. The man only knows that pressing the accelerators will increase the speed of car or applying brakes will stop the car but he does not know about how on 
pressing accelerator the speed is actually increasing, he does not know about the inner mechanism of the car or the implementation of accelerator, brakes etc in the car. This is what abstraction is.</p>

<p><strong>Abstractin using Classes:</strong>We can implement Abstraction in C++ using classes. Class helps us to group data members and member functions using available access specifiers. A Class can decide which data 
member will be visible to outside world and which is not.</p>

<p><strong>Abstraction in Header files</strong>One more type of abstraction in C++ can be header files. For example, consider the pow() method present in math.h header file. Whenever we need to calculate 
power of a number, we simply call the function pow() present in the math.h header file and pass the numbers as arguments without knowing the underlying algorithm according to which the function is 
actually calculating power of numbers.</p>

<h4>Advantages of Data Abstraction</h4>
<ol>
<li>Helps the user to avoid writing the low level code.</li>
<li>Avoids code duplication and increases reusability.</li>
<li>Can change internal implementation of class independently without affecting the user.</li>
<li> Helps to increase security of an application or program as only important details are provided to the user.</li>
</ol>

<div id="encapsulation">Encapsulation</div>

<p>In normal terms Encapsulation is defined as wrapping up of data and information under a single unit. In Object Oriented Programming, Encapsulation is defined as binding together the data and the functions 
that manipulates them. Consider a real life example of encapsulation, in a company there are different sections like the accounts section, finance section, sales section etc. The finance section handles all the 
financial transactions and keep records of all the data related to finance. Similarly the sales section handles all the sales related activities and keep records of all the sales. Now there may arise a situation 
when for some reason an official from finance section needs all the data about sales in a particular month. In this case, he is not allowed to directly access the data of sales section. He will first have to 
contact some other officer in the sales section and then request him to give the particular data. This is what encapsulation is. Here the data of sales section and the employees that can manipulate them are 
wrapped under a single name â€œsales sectionâ€.</p>

<p>Encapsulation also lead to data abstraction or hiding. As using encapsulation also hides the data. In the above example the data of any of the section like sales, finance or accounts is hidden from any other section.
In C++ encapsulation can be implemented using Class and access modifiers.</p>
